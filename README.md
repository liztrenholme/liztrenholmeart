# liztrenholmeart

A static website showcasing art I've created, styled with css and featuring a slideshow built with plain old vanilla JavaScript.

Archiving this and no longer updating.  My art will soon be at its new home at liztrenholme.com/art.  This was my first ever real project hosted on github, two very long evenings of learning how to tie together html, css and javascript into something cohesive and deployable.  Also, my first ever attempt at a javascript slideshow, which was REALLY difficult at the time for me! ðŸ˜€
